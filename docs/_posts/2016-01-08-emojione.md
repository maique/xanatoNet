I have to find a way to use [Emoji One](http://emojione.com/) on one of the (too)many projects I’m doing! I love it.  

It’s the coolest set of emoji around, and free to use under Creative Commons License (CC-BY 4.0). You can read all about it at their [licensing page](http://emojione.com/licensing/).
