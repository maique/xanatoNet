Now this is something that's been on my mind for a while now, and last Saturday was the day I finally took the time to do it.  
I went ahead and registered DinkiWinkiMinkiWinki as a domain, and now the splash page is live. Hosted on Adobe Portfolio, as I'm guessing this will be a photo project in the end. 

We'll see what comes out of it.

Not a lot to see, really, but it's something that had to be done.
