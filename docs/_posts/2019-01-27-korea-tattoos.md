[Grace Neutral](https://www.instagram.com/graceneutral/)'s documentary about tattooing and tattoos in Korea, for [i-D](https://i-d.vice.com/en_us).

Before going to Japan I always thought how people would look at me and treat me there, and I was pleasantly surprised that no one cared or said anything about my tattoos. We did spot the odd sign saying that tattoos were not allowed in a public bath, or somewhere like that, but not even a handful during our stay there.  

Korea is one place I'd love to visit, and this film made me go through all those feelings again.
