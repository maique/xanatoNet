We're stuck at home for a couple of months now. The Corona issue is still ongoing, and we can definitely count ourselves lucky, as we're living in a country where the virus is _controlled_ and managed to keep safe until now. We're double lucky because our in-laws kindly took us in, so we don't have to go through this experience in the city, and that's helping us deal with it a lot better.

We had a baby in the meantime, which would be a lot of trouble on our own with this mess going around. This level of support really makes a difference and we feel blessed every single day.   

As work stopped, I found myself trying to find a way to keep shooting. My wife, her parents and brother and the new baby became my subjects, and my [Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/maique/) is now a diary of our lives, and not the photos of other people and places as before.

And a new project was born, **theFencePortraits**. People have been coming by to visit, safely keeping their distance. I've been shooting them over the fence. If you'd like to take a look, feel free to visit [theFencePortraits](https://maiquemadeira.com/thefenceportraits). Hope you like it.
