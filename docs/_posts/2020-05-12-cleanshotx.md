I'm a screenshot addict. I am. Not sure if that because I'm a photographer, used to shoot everything as a sort of life's notebook. I see screenshots also as shots of our online lives, notes of things we see on the web. 

I loved and used a lot of apps to screenshot stuff on the Mac (I still remember pre-Evernote Skitch!), and then moved to the native macOS tool. Thousands os screenshots live on my computer and iPhone. 

Then I started using [YourStack](https://yourstack.com/@maique) and my life took a turn to the worst. Now I must have ALL the apps on the site, all of them seem Must Haves. Sadly this comes at at time when money is a bit shorter, so I have pick them carefully. 

But then I saw Chris Messina's [comment](https://yourstack.com/@chrismessina/uses/CleanShot) on ClearShot X and it took me a whole two minutes to get my card out and purchase this one. 

A quick visit to [Clear Shot's site](https://getcleanshot.com), and I was sold.

A lot of features to love, and still a lot to discover.

Cleanshot Cloud will save your screenies for a month (unlimited will come later with a Pro subscription) and you get a sharable link for those. 
Scrolling Capture for those times when the thing you're screenshooting needs some, well, scrolling.
And so much more...

Maybe watch the video:

</div>

I'm sure you'll be sold too.
