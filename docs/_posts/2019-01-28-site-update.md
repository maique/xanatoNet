It's getting bigger. Much much bigger.  
I'll have to edit this to, at least, half it's size.

Three months = a shitload of photos, and this is getting a bit out of hand. I want to include everything, but now I'm realizing a lot of them have to be out, the page would take forever to load otherwise. Three countries left and there are simply too many photos. 

Tomorrow is another day, and I'll take care of that. 

In the meantime I've started the domain transfer from Squarespace to DreamHost, and then it's off to Adobe Portfolio. They say it might take a week. We'll see about that.
