The site moved. It's done. 

My site has been hosted at Squarespace for ages, and I'm not using a huge part of what they offer. I couldn’t justify the cost and decided to take advantage of the hosting available at Adobe Portfolio, free for their [Creative Cloud Photography Plan](https://www.adobe.com/pt/creativecloud/photography.html).  

Squarespace offers an amazing service, but my needs are pretty basic, so there's no point in paying for stuff I don't use. 

Moving a site is a time consuming task, importing the galleries was not possible, so I had to remake the galleries by hand. Some are still incomplete, others will probably be lost during the process, and new ones will show up.

A few photos are already there, so you can still have an idea of my kind of work. 

The domain was also hosted at Squarespace, and had to be transferred to DreamHost, where all the others are, before pointing it to it’s new home at Adobe. Easy to do, just follow along the instructions. A week waiting for the transfer to complete, but everything went as smoothly as expected. 

One issue, the SSL certificate was not issued, but a quick email to Adobe support sorted that out.
Not a whole day went by since the first email was sent until the matter was solved. 

Email is still hosted at FastMail, I’m so happy with their services that I don’t think I’ll ever move. MX records updated, up and running in less than 15 minutes. 

There's still a lot of work to do, but it's working already, so it's just a matter of finding the time to keep editing it.  

You can visit the new site at the usual address [maiquemadeira.com](https://maiquemadeira.com).

Enjoy.
