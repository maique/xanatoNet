Almost done with the upload process, [theAmazingHoneymoon](https://www.flickr.com/photos/maique/albums/72157705041786135) album now has over 2000 photos, even though only a few are set to _public_.  
You can browse them already , but the editing process, and deciding which ones will be shown in the end, is still ongoing.

It's taking a long time, I know, but uploading from the iPhone is a slow ordeal. It's been over a month now, and I can't even tell you how many hours I've spent already tagging photos.

Also not easy having to go through all of them and remember how much fun we had last year. Sigh.
