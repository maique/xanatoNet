London is calling. After all these years, we're going. We've gone around the world, and now it's time for a trip to London.

We had an amazing offer, a place to stay, so that's taken care of.  
Now we're researching and collecting all the places we'd like to visit while there, and still not sure what app I'll use for that.  
[Maps.me](https://maps.me) has served us right in the past, but I'd like to give [Rego](https://rego.to) another chance. Still not convinced...
