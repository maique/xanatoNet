Need a free responsive, customizable website in minutes ? 

Head to [HTML5 Up](https://html5up.net/) and grab one of the available themes (there are loads) and go crazy.

You can even use them on GitHub Pages, and they do look great. Might use one of them on my next project. Whatever that might be.
