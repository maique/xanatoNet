The site is moving.  
I'll leave Squarespace and move my domain to Adobe Portfolio. I don't really use Squarespace's multitude of features, and Adobe Portfolio is included with the plan I'm subscribed to.

I've been trying to find the time to take care of the whole moving process, but I keep getting derailed. Still a couple of months left on my Squarespace plan, but I really need to start getting things done.

It's a long way to the end, but today I went at it again, and working on a new gallery: theAmazingHoneymoon. A ton of photos to upload, and some of the ones already there will probably be taken down before it's ready.  
Anyway, if you'd like to take a look, feel free to [visit](https://maique.myportfolio.com/theamazinghoneymoon) and let me know what you think about it.
