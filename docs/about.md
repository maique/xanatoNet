## Hey there, my name is maique.

A long time ago I registered this domain, and it hosted a blog for a while. It was my first domain. At the moment it has a couple of emails still attached to it, emails I'm trying to deactivate, but I wasn't using it for anything else.  

So... new playground! Yay!

I [tweet](http://twitter.com/maique). Maybe too much.

Occasionally I'm also a photographer. Some shots are up on [flickr](http://flickr.com/photos/maique/).  
There's also an [instagram](http://instagram.com/maique) account.

If you're looking for an _official_ site, there's one at [maiquemadeira.com](http://maiquemadeira.com/).

Enjoy.
